In today’s era, companies work hard to make their customers happy. They launch new technologies and services so that customers can use their products more. They try to be in touch with each of their customers so that they can provide goods accordingly. But practically, it’s very difficult and non-realistic to keep in touch with everyone. So, here comes the usage of Customer Segmentation.

Customer Segmentation means the segmentation of customers on the basis of their similar characteristics, behavior, and needs. This will eventually help the company in many ways. Like, they can launch the product or enhance the features accordingly. They can also target a particular sector as per their behaviors. All of these lead to an enhancement in the overall market value of the company.

Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python
Today we will be using Machine Learning to implement the task of Customer Segmentation.

The libraries we will be required are : 
Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations.
Matplotlib / Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation
